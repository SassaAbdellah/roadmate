== HowTo: Run Unit Tests ==
#Setup your google app engine at port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/).
#Run roadmate web application from localhost  eg: dev_appserver.py ./roadmate
#Run selenium remote control server.
#Check out tests folder from google code repository /trunk/roadmate/tests.    
#cd d:\tests  (Assuming your checkout tests folder is located at your computer d:\tests.)
#Now you can run your unit test cases. eg: python test_rideoffer.py
#From console window , you will be able to see test results.
